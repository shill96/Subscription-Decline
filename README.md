# Subscription-Decline
Remember when flipping through a magazine was a common pastime? With the rise of digital content, one might expect magazine subscriptions to decline, but what if that’s not the full story? Even during periods when people spent more time at home, subscription rates didn’t see the expected boost. Instead, they dropped.
What’s driving this shift? Is it changing consumer preferences, economic constraints, or something deeper?

In this analysis, we take a data-driven approach to uncover the factors behind declining magazine subscriptions. By examining demographic, behavioral, and transactional data, we aim to identify key patterns using machine learning. After rigorous data cleaning and preparation, we’ll compare the performance of logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM) to determine which model provides the best insights.
